# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Embark on a path of government research where professionals contribute to improving public health and proactively preventing heart disease in the population. In a specialized domain, a notable approach involves single-class classification for detecting the presence or absence of heart disease, particularly in advancing cardiovascular research. This dataset provides an opportunity to develop models capable of accurately determining the existence of heart diseases, emphasizing the critical role of government-funded research in enhancing public health and preemptively addressing cardiovascular challenges in the population.

**Heart Disease Prediction** <br />
Experience the life of a researcher by predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using their medical data.

**Dataset** <br />
The dataset is a collection of patients' data that includes their age, sex, cholesterol level, chest pain level, and other variables regarding their health. Use these indicator variables to predict the presence of heart disease in these patients.

**Prediction** <br />
The last column of the dataset is called HeartDisease and this is the column that you will be predicting. The values in this HeartDisease column are either 0 - normal, or 1 - presence of heart disease. This type of classification problem is called binary classification since there are only 2 classes in the target column. Your team must build a model to best accurately predict the result of the HeartDisease column based on all the other columns in the dataset.

**Task** <br />
predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a variety of factors such as age, maximum heart rate, cholesterol levels, and more.
